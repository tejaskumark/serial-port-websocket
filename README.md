Serial Port over Websocket
This project will allow you to access serial port over websocket, so that you can easily access your serial port into browser.
- It helps you with faster access to serial port
- It also logs activity on serial port eventhough there are no user session active, so one can debug any issues with help of serial logs.

Setup:
- First modify config.yaml as per your port requirement.
- Compile as per your platform requirement.

- Access hompage in your browser

TODO -
 - Need to add support for HTTPS.
